Discrimination (or some form and extent of it) is somewhat common in human behaviour. How discrimination is defined varies, and is extremely difficult to pinpoint. We tolerate different actions differently, and we categorize actions uniquely. We also naturally treat and judge others (maybe significantly) differently based on perceptible qualities, characteristics, and other factors. I believe discrimination is related to natural assumptions and prejudice, whilst also being far more substantial and extreme. To elaborate specifically on assumptions and prejudice: a form of either is not always “bad”. It's also inherent to humans; they have their benefits and disadvantages. 
A form of these “assumptions” may be the "bundling" or "generalization" of behaviours/opinions that are believed to be "categorizable". This may occur under many circumstances, for example: 

e.g., certain people with quality {a} usually are in group {1}; therefore, all people in group {1} have quality {a}. 

I would classify the situation provided as a “character” or “quality” assumption. It is assuming a quality/characteristic for a person due to category/group. There are numerous scenarios where it may occur, whether or not it is desired. 
Similar assumptions can also be made for grouping/categorization and perception of frequency: 

e.g., since group {1} has more people with {a}, someone with {a} likely may be in group {1}. 

This example would perhaps be an "(in)group assumption", the assumption being the group/category for a person. It's similar to my first example, but with the difference being if we assume the group (the ‘larger’ categorization) or the quality (something more ‘narrow’). As categorization relies on quality, the method used as a form of distinguishment for the examples was using a different, unrelated, non-inherent quality, specifically with a different scope/ability to categorize. Similar forms of assumptions are often made, and they may be good or bad depending on the situation and extent they are applied.Having a significant opinion by ‘generalizing’ a category or specific quality is easier than having an individual opinion on every combination of quality and category. It is a common mental heuristic.
