1. How do we judge and express empathy?

Often in society, I find that we commentate on the empathy of others. Similarly, I believe we also tend to show a higher degree of empathy to non-human animals on average (eg; cats and dogs). I believe that both are significant, or relate to something signifiant, in how we show empathy in an interestingly selective manner.

<!--Other animals show empathy towards each other. This is something we have observed and tested. (eg; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3760221/pdf/nihms504750.pdf)--> 

We may speak of others and how they lack empathy, and how such horrible people they are, but is the lack of empathy equivalent to being a horrible person? Do all horrible people lack empathy? By assumption, I believe that if someone was being tortured, and you were able to easily free them form being tortured (eg; pressing a button), there would be many cases where many of people would not free certain people (think of eg; rapists, pedophiles, or politicians?, etc). And if you did free such people, that is empathy nonetheless. There are definitely situations where you wouldn't free the other person, would leave them to be tortured, but that probably doesn't mean you lack empathy or are a horrible person. Whether or not one deserves to be tortured, or whether one deserves empathy is a different question, but the fact is that we are selective with our empathy due to our own human complexities. It is due to our nature of being such complicated species where I believe our selectiveness arises; differ in politics, opinion, views, etc, and as other species lack this, their possible empathy towards each other (if they already often do, eg; rats) is more broadly expressed. Additionally, due to this reason, our expression towards other animials is also more broad: we more widely and easily show empathy to dogs, cats, and other species as a whole. The complexities possessed by humans allows us to more readily and easily show hatred and heavily dislike to other humans. 

I propose a theoretical scenario where we were to conduct a similar experiment as to the one featuring rats, (eg; using a human in a position where they are given the ability to free another human who is being tortured, and we repeat this 10 times per human). Let's say at everyone in this scenario had at least half of the humans heavily disagree with a crucial opinion they had, and we throw in a number of rapists and other hated people in there as well. If the result is that nearly every human does not free all or near all of the humans in their 10 trials, would it really be reasonable to conclude that everyone lacks empathy? Probably not; people would argue how they had reasons as to why someone deserves to be tortured, as to why they did not free the person being tortured. (Note: additional statement here)

My intent I desired to communicate with the heavily flawed scenario given prior is that we are far more easily capable of reasoning/justifying as to why we ourselves would not show empathy in some cases, and how we can more easily critize or even assume the total lack of empathy for some other people. Some people might lack empathy completely, but most humans do not. We are all selective when it comes to empathy and many things, and I am almost certain there are scenarios of which anyone would not show empathy to another human.
